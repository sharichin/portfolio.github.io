#### [Internal Blog Post Project](/Plant_Powerbi_Analysis.md)
<img src="images/Plant Co Sales Performance Analysis.png"/>
This analysis offers insights and recommendations for a global e-commerce plant supplier specializing in indoor and outdoor plants. I utilized Excel and PowerBI to clean, transform, and evaluate sales trends from 2022 to 2024, presenting key performance metrics in a dashboard. With an 11% decline in indoor plant sales and a 13% drop in gross profit, optimizing the cost of goods sold and implementing a re-pricing strategy for both top and underperforming indoor and landscape plants could create opportunities to boost revenue.

In this project, I used Excel to clean, analyze, and create a quarterly variance report for a client to investigate a decline in their Quarter 2 sales volume in one of their regions. I conducted a budget variance analysis and a simple forecast, concluding that the loss of two clients in the affected region resulted in a 7k volume decrease, which previously constituted 57% of the market share for the company in that region.

#### [Internal Blog Post Project](/sql_healthcare_project.md)
<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Github Cover.png"/>
In this project, I chose to practice SQL querying from multiple sources to provide analysis of 1999-2008 hospital care and patient information from 130 hospitals. Since there is a fine line between balancing business productivity and customer service, I explored the data to understand why managing patient turnover in hospitals beds is an important part of business operations.

#### [Internal Blog Post Project](/tableau_nba_project.md)
<img src="images/NBA Github Cover.png"/>
For this project, I analyzed basketball players' individual and team performance from the 2022-2023 NBA Season. Since the data included both player and team statistics, I explored the details to identify areas players and teams could potentially improve in. Also in my analysis, I chose to highlight 4 teams (Miami Heat, Atlanta Hawks, Portland Trail Blazers and San Francisco Golden State Warriors) to showcase teams from the East and West coast in cities I've had the opportunity to experience and live in.

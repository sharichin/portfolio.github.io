#### [Internal Blog Post Project](/HUD_Housing_Analysis.md)

In this project, I examined median house sales and household income data in 12 metropolitan areas across the US from 2018 to 2022 to understand how housing prices affect Americans across various income levels using Excel, SQL querying, and Tableau. The metropolitan areas selected for analysis, have been identified by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as regions that could benefit from expanded homeownership opportunities.

#### [Internal Blog Post Project](/tableau_nba_project.md)
<img src="images/NBA Github Cover.png"/>
For this project, I analyzed basketball players' individual and team performance from the 2022-2023 NBA Season. Since the data included both player and team statistics, I explored the details to identify areas players and teams could potentially improve in. Also in my analysis, I chose to highlight 4 teams (Miami Heat, Atlanta Hawks, Portland Trail Blazers and San Francisco Golden State Warriors) to showcase teams from the East and West coast in cities I've had the opportunity to experience and live in.

#### [Internal Blog Post Project](/sql_healthcare_project.md)
<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Github Cover.png"/>
In this project, I chose to practice SQL querying from multiple sources to provide analysis of 1999-2008 hospital care and patient information from 130 hospitals. Since there is a fine line between balancing business productivity and customer service, I explored the data to understand why managing patient turnover in hospitals beds is an important part of business operations.

In this project, I used Python to provide analysis on mineral ore flotation testing for a manufacturing mining company. I was asked to investigate an incident that occurred June 1, 2017 by observing the changes in mineral concentration hourly throughout the day. To do this, I analyzed the following  4 main variables: % Iron Concentrate, % Silica Concentrate, Ore pulp pH, and Flotation Column 05 Level.

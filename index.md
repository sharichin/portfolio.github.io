#### [Linked File Project](/files/DAA Intern Job Analysis Presentationv1.pdf)
<img src="images/Salary Boxplot Outliers Github Cover.png"/>
In this project, I gained experience working in a team through the full life cycle of a data project using Excel, Python and Tableau. This project is based on job posts webscraped from Google's search results between Q4 2022 to Q4 2023. My role included leading the team; and preparing, processing and analyzing the dataset.

#### [Internal Blog Post Project](/tableau_nba_project.md)
<img src="images/NBA Github Cover.png"/>
For this project, I analyzed basketball players' individual and team performance from the 2022-2023 NBA Season. Since the data included both player and team statistics, I explored the details to identify areas players and teams could potentially improve in. Also in my analysis, I chose to highlight 4 teams (Miami Heat, Atlanta Hawks, Portland Trail Blazers and San Francisco Golden State Warriors) to showcase teams from the East and West coast in cities I've had the opportunity to experience and live in.

#### [Internal Blog Post Project](/sql_healthcare_project.md)
<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Github Cover.png"/>
In this project, I chose to practice SQL querying from multiple sources to provide analysis of 1999-2008 hospital care and patient information from 130 hospitals. Since there is a fine line between balancing business productivity and customer service, I explored the data to understand why managing patient turnover in hospitals beds is an important part of business operations.

#### [Internal Blog Post Project](/education_project.md)
<img src="images/Github Mass Cover.png"/>
In this case study from the Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the state of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were:
What schools are struggling the most?
How does class size affect college admission?
What are the top math schools in the state?

#### [Linked File Project](/files/iFood Doordash Portfolio Presentation 3.pdf)
<img src="images/IFood Github Cover.png"/>
For this project, I explored what a good analytics PowerPoint presentation should entail. It has key insights, ties data to the business value and much more.

#### [Linked File Project](/files/Python Manufacturing Presentation.pdf)
<img src="images/Mining Github Cover.png"/>
In this project, I used Python to provide analysis on mineral ore flotation testing for a manufacturing mining company. I was asked to investigate an incident that occurred June 1, 2017 by observing the changes in mineral concentration hourly throughout the day. To do this, I analyzed the following  4 main variables: % Iron Concentrate, % Silica Concentrate, Ore pulp pH, and Flotation Column 05 Level.
